# Digital_Signal_Processing

To gain experience in implementing and analyzing digital systems within MATLAB, creating projects in CCS5 and running programs on the TMS 320 DSP processor
Sure, I'd be happy to help you write a README for your GitHub repository that showcases your projects related to digital signals using MATLAB. A well-structured README is essential to help others understand your work and use your code effectively. Here's a template you can use as a starting point:

This GitHub repository contains a collection of projects related to digital signals and signal processing, implemented using MATLAB. Each project focuses on different aspects of digital signal processing, from fundamental concepts to practical filter design techniques.

## Project List

1. **Introduction to Digital Signals using MATLAB**
   - An introductory project that covers the basics of digital signal processing and showcases some essential MATLAB functions and techniques for working with digital signals.

2. **Discrete-time Fourier Analysis and Sampling**
   - Explore the discrete-time Fourier analysis and sampling theory, and how to apply these concepts in MATLAB.

3. **Resampling, Reconstruction, and the DFT**
   - Learn about resampling techniques, signal reconstruction, and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in MATLAB. Understand how to manipulate the sampling rate and spectral properties of a signal.

4. **FIR Digital Filter Design**
   - Implement Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter design techniques using MATLAB. This project explores filter design, filter analysis, and application examples.

5. **IIR Digital Filter Design**
   - Dive into the world of Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) digital filter design using MATLAB. Understand the design principles, real-world applications, and how to implement IIR filters effectively.

6. **Matched Filters for Detection of BPSK and BFSK Signals**
   - In digital communication, modulating signals with carrier waves helps in noise resilience. Using a matched filter optimizes signal-to-noise ratio during detection, reducing error probability in binary signal detection amidst spectrally white noise.
